# Hi there!

I'm Angel, a software engineer from Manila, Philippines.

I'm mostly interested in full-stack development and currently work on personal projects.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact applications and have contributed to major feature updates.

Recreationally, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also cultivate a lot of hobbies and keep up on tech-related news.
